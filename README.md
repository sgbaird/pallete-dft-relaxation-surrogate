# pallete-dft-relaxation-surrogate
Pallete image processing models ([unofficial](https://github.com/Janspiry/Palette-Image-to-Image-Diffusion-Models)) (e.g. JPEG restoration, inpainting), adapted to act as a surrogate model for density functional theory (DFT) relaxation of crystal structures and for structure prediction.
